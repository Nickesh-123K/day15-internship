        <h2><ul>
            <li>Let food be the medicine and medicine be the food</li>
            <li>People who love to eat are always the best people</li>
            <li>Cooking is like love. It should be entered into with abandon or not at all</li>
        </ul></h2>
        <p class="p1">Food is more than just sustenance, it is a language that speaks to our senses and brings people together. Whether you're a food enthusiast, a passionate chef, or simply someone who appreciates the art of cuisine, sharing your culinary adventures on Instagram has become a delightful ritual. However, finding the perfect words to accompany your mouthwatering food photos can sometimes be a challenging task.</p>
        <p class="p2">We cannot deny the importance of food in our lives. As it is the basic need to survive. Yet some people waste not thinking that there are still some people that do not get any of it. We should always be careful while taking a meal on our plates.</p>
